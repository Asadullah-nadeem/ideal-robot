Websockets are like 📞 phones for the internet! They let websites talk to servers in real-time, sending and receiving messages instantly. 🌐 Unlike regular web connections, websockets stay open, making communication speedy. Node.js, a cool JavaScript runtime, pairs perfectly with websockets, handling connections smoothly. 🚀 MySQL, a database buddy, stores and retrieves data for your web app. To dodge plagiarism, keep it original! Node.js has tools, like ESLint, to ensure your code is unique. Remember, copying is a no-no! Stay creative, use your own words, and build a fantastic, plagiarism-free web experience! 🛠️👩‍💻
